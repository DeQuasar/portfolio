bio: I love untangling messy systems and making them easy for customers and teams to trust. Whether I’m triaging an SLA breach or pairing with a teammate on a Vue component, I keep a steady cadence, document decisions, and share context freely. Outside of work, I’m the go-to tech sounding board for local founders and an enthusiastic caretaker of clean, maintainable repos.
