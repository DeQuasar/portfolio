    summary:
      - Run frontline support for every client app—reply within 48 hours, get quotes out by day five, and close approved fixes in roughly 10 days.
      - Keep our riskiest production app alive as its maintainer and lead dev, pouring hundreds of hours into calming brittle SOAP integrations and killing repeat bugs.
      - Drop shared tooling upgrades (Sentry, Laravel Shift, Reverb, Horizon) into the stack so upkeep is less painful for everyone.
      - Mentor teammates through triage and maintenance work so more folks can ship fixes without waiting on me.
      - Loop in clients and PMs when the queue needs sorting so expectations stay realistic and escalations stay rare.
    projects:
      - title: Portfolio support modernization
        summary: Pulled support, maintenance, and feature requests into one flow with clear expectations.
        problem: Triage, upkeep, and new work were coming through different channels, so priority issues kept getting buried.
        contribution: Consolidated everything into a single board, ran daily triage passes, kept the fragile SOAP-heavy app stable, and still shipped the backlog’s high-leverage fixes.
        impact: Held responses inside two days, quotes around five days, and approved fixes inside roughly 10 days while keeping clients in the loop.

      - Mentorship
    summary:
      - Designed the lease-intelligence dashboard backend so it chews through 300k–600k row datasets in about 3–6 seconds for investor demos.
      - Framed out the Vue dashboard, then paired with the assigned engineer until they were comfortable shipping new slices solo.
      - Sat in senior engineering syncs to match roadmap work with fundraising deadlines and jumped into bug triage when the queue flared up.
    projects:
      - title: Lease analytics dashboard
        summary: Guided a brand-new team through delivering the dashboard that Leasecake needed for investor conversations.
        problem: Leadership needed a metrics dashboard in about four months, but none of us had deep domain context and the data volume was steep.
        contribution: Led planning and mentoring, built the metric engine, and kept the squad focused so we shipped in roughly four and a half months.
        impact: Launched the dashboard in production—crunching big datasets in ~3–6 seconds—and gave execs something solid to carry into the fundraising tour.

      - Team leadership
    summary:
      - Ran the push to rebuild our 3D event-space frontend on a brutal timeline, lining up engineers, artists, and stakeholders the whole way.
      - Spent mornings in the code and the rest of the day running standups, reviews, and unblockers so the team kept moving.
      - Worked directly with execs and the client on scope, dependencies, and updates—launch hit, client was happy, and I walked away promoted.
    projects:
      - title: Virtual event platform refresh
        summary: Shipped the refreshed virtual event front end on the timeline the client picked.
        problem: The 3D environment refresh had a fixed launch date, lots of moving parts, and a front-end crew that needed day-to-day direction once backend work wrapped.
        contribution: Coordinated the front-end devs, kept stakeholders aligned, unblocked issues, and still contributed morning coding sessions on critical pieces.
        impact: Rolled out on the agreed deadline, the 3D front-end experience ran without a hitch, and the client signed off without requesting follow-up fixes.
