      - Diagnose and resolve complex production issues in legacy and modern codebases, applying root-cause analysis and durable fixes that prevent recurrence.

      - title: Portfolio support modernization
        summary: Pulled support, maintenance, and feature requests into one flow with clear expectations.
        problem: Triage, upkeep, and new work were coming through different channels, so priority issues kept getting buried.
        contribution: Consolidated everything into a single board, ran daily triage passes, kept the fragile SOAP-heavy app stable, and still shipped the backlog’s high-leverage fixes.
        impact: Held responses inside two days, quotes around five days, and approved fixes inside roughly 10 days while keeping clients in the loop.

    role: Team Lead - Senior Software Developer
    location: Winter Park, FL (Remote)
    period: September 2022 - June 2023
    summary:
      - Designed and implemented a backend architecture for a complex data visualization feature using Laravel, integrating efficiently with Vue.js on the frontend.
      - Mentored a developer through the UI implementation process, promoting maintainable code practices and consistency across the project.
      - Optimized time-series queries, improving performance by approximately 70% through targeted SQL refactoring and query analysis.

    projects:
      - title: Lease analytics dashboard
        summary: Guided a brand-new team through delivering the dashboard that Leasecake needed for investor conversations.
        problem: Leadership needed a metrics dashboard in about four months, but none of us had deep domain context and the data volume was steep.
        contribution: Led planning and mentoring, built the metric engine, and kept the squad focused so we shipped in roughly four and a half months.
        impact: Launched the dashboard in production—crunching big datasets in ~3–6 seconds—and gave execs something solid to carry into the fundraising tour.

    projects:
      - title: Virtual event platform refresh
        summary: Shipped the refreshed virtual event front end under a razor-thin deadline the client imposed.
        problem: The 3D environment refresh had a fixed launch date, lots of moving parts, and a front-end crew that needed day-to-day direction once backend work wrapped.
        contribution: Coordinated the front-end devs, kept stakeholders aligned, unblocked issues, and still contributed morning coding sessions on critical pieces.
        impact: Rolled out on the agreed deadline, the 3D front-end experience ran without a hitch, and the client signed off without requesting follow-up fixes.
